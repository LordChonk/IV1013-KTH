# StreamCipher Assignment

This assignment covers Stream Ciphers where the tasks cover the encryption of some arbitrary plaintext

# Task1
Task1 is the basic implementation of a stream cipher which takes a plaintext message and an encryption key as inputs. The output will be a cipher text consisting of the encrypted sequence of bytes

# Task2
Task2 builds on Task1 where we are to develop our own PRNG as a subclass of the Java Random class

# Task3
Task3 is essentially the same as Task1 and Task2 except that now we are to use the RC4 PRNG to solve the tasks
